<h1 class="bigHeader">When was your last home loan health check?</h1>

<div class="content">

<div class="newsArticle">

<p><strong>Circumstances can change, leaving your home loan less suitable than it was originally. A home loan health check can reveal if you’re paying too much.</strong></p>

<h2>What’s involved?</h2>

<p>Your finance broker can do a full home loan health check for you either in person or over the phone. They will check if your loan is still competitive and still suited to your individual needs.</p>
<p>Having an expert do this for you can also take the stress out of the process for you. It is advisable to get this check done at least once a year, or if your circumstances change.</p>

<h2>Questions to ask</h2>
<h2><img class="newsImage" src="https://custommortgageandloans.com.au/images/saving.jpg" alt="How much can you save?" width="300" height="182"/></h2>

<p>Be aware of what you want checked. Think about the following when you speak to your broker:</p>

<div class="outerList">
  <ul>
<div class="innerList"><li>Am I paying an unreasonably high interest rate?</li></p>
<div class="innerList"><li>Am I paying high fees?</li></div>
<div class="innerList"><li>Am I happy with the service I receive?</li></div>
<div class="innerList"><li>Does my loan give me the features I need?</li></div>
<div class="innerList"><li>Am I paying for features I don't use?</li></div>
<div class="innerList"><li>Have my financial circumstances changed?</li></div>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>A home-loan health check will generally cost you nothing and could save you thousands. Your home loan features could be improved or you could find yourself with a lower interest rate. A better payment structure could also be introduced, making your repayments more manageable.</p>
<p>Checking the state of your current loan could uncover the possibility of taking out additional finance, which can consolidate any other debt you may have or help you purchase an investment property.</p>

<h1 class="bigHeader" >Selling your home? Here are the first steps to take</h1>
<div class="newsArticle">
<p><strong>There is more to selling your home than putting up a ‘For Sale’ sign on your front lawn. Here are the first things you should check off your list to help you get the largest return from your investment and to ensure the process runs as smoothly as possible.</strong></p>

<h2>Choose a quality agent</h2>

<p>Asking family and friends who have purchased or sold a property about their experience is a great way to ensure the agent you’ve enlisted will provide quality service, explains the MFAA accredited finance broker. “A website and promotional material will always highlight the agent in the best possible way, but word of mouth and past client reviews will show their true colours,” she says.</p>

<p>Make sure the agent specialises in your area and is someone you feel comfortable around as they don’t just negotiate prices on your behalf, they also act as a mediator and represent you as a vendor.</p>

<h2>Prepare the paperwork</h2>

<h2><img class="newsImage" src="https://custommortgageandloans.com.au/images/paperwork.jpg" alt="Get your paperwork in order" width="300" height="225"/></h2>

<p>Getting together all the documents required is a tedious yet necessary part of the process. Before a property can be marketed for sale, your agent requires a copy of the Contract from your legal representative, explains the broker. From a disclosure document to a home loan pre-approval, ensure all the paperwork is prepared in time to ensure it all runs smoothly.</p>

<h2>Don’t take things personally</h2>

<p>Remember this is a business transaction; don’t feel insulted if you receive feedback on the property that doesn’t match how you feel about your home. To ensure you come out with the best deal, remove all emotion and think of your house as a commodity.</p>

<h2>Your property won’t sell itself</h2>
<p>Thinking that your home will sell itself can be a costly mistake. Despite how much you like the way you have it set up, furniture, flooring and painting changes can make a big difference to the property’s wider appeal, and marketing it widely can increase the competition and, therefore, the price. </p>

<p>“Engage in a thorough marketing campaign and invest in presenting your property in its best light,” advises the finance broker. “Trusting your agent’s strategy can help secure the best financial result.”</p>

<h2>Speak to your broker</h2>

<p>If you are making a decision to sell, speak to your finance broker to ensure that your plans after selling – whether they are buying a similar property, upgrading or building – are actually feasible.</p>

<p>“I always advise clients to speak to their broker first to make sure their plans for post-settlement are realistic,” says the finance broker. “There is nothing worse than selling your home and then not being able to achieve what you had set out to do.”</p>

<h2>Surround yourself with a good team</h2>

<p>When all of the people in your network, including your broker, conveyancer and agent, communicate effectively, you should be blissfully unaware of any minor issues that pop up during the course of the sale, explains the finance broker.</p>

<p>MFAA accredited finance brokers must meet the highest industry standards, so they will be able to refer you to a great agent and other professionals that will help make the home selling process flow with minimal stress.</p>
