<p>A bridging loan may be necessary to cover the financial gap when buying one property before your existing one is sold. This finance is secured against the existing property (utilising equity) and the new property being purchased. Usually, bridging loans are short term (normally 6 months) to allow for the sale of the original property and are more expensive than other types of loans. There are alternative ways to finance a change from one home to another, so please talk with us to discuss your options.

<img class="tinyImage" src="https://custommortgageandloans.com.au/images/construction.jpg" alt="Construction and renovation loans" width="200" height="133"/>

<p>Looking to build a new house or renovate your existing home? Then there are several Sunshine Coast loans available. But which is the most suitable for you depends on your circumstance.</p>

</div>
<div style="display: inline;">

<p>A common approach is for borrowers to access some of the equity they’ve built up through a home equity loan, given they already own a property. Another option for renovators is to refinance their mortgage to borrow more money to fund the renovation.</p>

<p>For new builds, a construction loan differs from a conventional loan in that the lender will not release the full amount in one lump sum, rather in progress payments as the construction progresses.</p>

<div class="servicesParagraph">

<img class="tinyImage" src="https://custommortgageandloans.com.au/images/landPurchase.jpg" alt="Land purchase loan" width="200" height="133"/>

<p>A land purchase loan differs from a regular home loan as lenders generally see them as riskier. As such, land loans typically have higher deposits and interest rates.</p>

</div>
<div style="display: inline;">

<p>Land loans are mainly used instead of construction loans when the borrowers know they won’t be able to complete construction on the vacant block of land within the specified time frame. The time limit for a construction loan to build the new home is usually 1 to 3 years.</p>

<div class="servicesParagraph">

<img class="tinyImage" src="https://custommortgageandloans.com.au/images/reverseMortgage.jpg" alt="Reverse mortgage" width="200" height="133"/>

<p>What is a reverse mortgage and how does it work? In short, a reverse mortgage is a loan that uses the equity on your current home as security; the equity being the value of the property after you have taken away the amount left to pay on the mortgage.</p>

</div>
<div style="display:inline;">

<p>Reverse mortgages were aimed at retirees with limited income to aid them in their retirement plan. Typically, they are suited for people who will remain in their home for the long-term. Although, there is no hard and fast rule on this. Anyone can apply for a reverse mortgage given the right circumstance. To find out if you can, <a href="https://custommortgageandloans.com.au/contact.php" title="Go to contact page">enquire here today</a>.</p>
